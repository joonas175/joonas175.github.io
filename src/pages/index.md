## What?
This website acts as my personal portfolio. [Projects](/projects) page contains my previous and current work, including
work, school and hobby projects. Currently available only in English; the business is very international, so
[i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) has low priority for me in this case.

## Who?
Joonas Salojärvi, a full stack developer from Tampere, Finland. See more about me on the [author](/author) page.

## How?
Astro with static page generation, hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain. And the domain is cool, am I right? Deployed straight
from main branch with Astro's own workflow. Currently using Svelte and Vue frameworks for components, in addition to Astro's own component
syntax. See [portfolio repository](https://github.com/joonas175/portfolio) on GitHub for reference.

### Confused?
This website is designed with idea and UI over accessibility, sorry about that. Might do a more accessible version in the future.
