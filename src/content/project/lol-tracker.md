# Cocktail Kamu

App to track the summoner spell in Riot Gamesâ€™ League of Legends. 
Summoners spells are crucial to gameplay, and have long cooldowns. 
App will fetch given players current match information, and display enemy champions with their summoner spells and their cooldowns. 
Pressing on a summoner spell will set that spell to cooldown. 
Automatic summoner spell tracking is considered cheating, so that is why user interaction is required.
