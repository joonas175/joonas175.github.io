# Cocktail Kamu

A site for cocktail and other drink lovers. 
The basic idea is that you can input what ingredients you own, and the site will show you which drinks and cocktails you can make. 
Users can also add their own drinks and ingredients to the database. 
Only “verified” drinks are shown by default, to filter out all spam etc. 
Includes authentication, sign in required to add recipes.
