# Oscar cERP

A web-based ERP solution, which is a user-friendly interface for Oscar Software's business platform,
consisting of many applications.

## Work

I worked as part of the Oscar cERP project development team, as a full stack developer.
Work consisted of developing new features, bug fixing and deployment to production.
Deployment needed Linux shell knowledge.

Used frameworks and tools:
- Liferay
- Vue 2
- Spring Boot
- Node.js
- Oracle SQL Developer
- Shell

## Notable features

Some bigger features, where I was the biggest contributor.

### ADFS Integration

Creating a plugin for Liferay, which added the [ADFS OpenID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/development/ad-fs-openid-connect-oauth-concepts)
authorization flow to Liferay.

### Facelift

Complete rework of the layout. I did most of the theming and action logic for the core layout. A lot of portlets were redone by me also, but the rest of the
team stepped in during the project. The layout overhaul had some code refactoring in it, fixing a lot of bugs encountered during the facelift process.
During the process I learned a lot about CSS/SCSS, JSP and Velocity templates, and plain JS DOM manipulation.
