        "content": "I have always been interested in computers, and got my first desktop PC when I was 8 years old. Since then, I have spent most of my free time in front of a monitor. I tried programming for the first time when I was 12 years old with a language called CoolBasic. I never hesitated to pop my computer case open to problem solve hardware issues by myself, and that's how I learned most of the stuff; through trial and error.\n\nI've had many jobs in my life, mostly part time. My first work experiences were washing dishes in restaurants during busy days. After that I've been a worker at a plastic factory, an interviewer, a webmaster, a substitute teacher and a worker at a logistics company. My favorite was probably being a substitute teacher, because I was just out of high school and only a couple of years older than my students. I got along well with the students and really enjoyed doing my job.\n\nI did my mandatory military service in Finnish Rapid Deployment Forces, in a unit specialized in CBRN defense. I found it fitting, since I studied physics and chemistry in high school, and I think it was one of the most interesting years of my life. I ended my service as an NCO.\n\nDuring my free time I like to lift weights and play video games. During summer I also like to jog. I'm a hard-working and social person with a good sense of humor. I'm a DIY kind of guy; I brew my own beer and also have experimented with wines (honey mead to be precise, inspired by The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim)."
